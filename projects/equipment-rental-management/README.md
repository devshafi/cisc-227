# Equipment Rental Management (ERM)

A small Flask REST API for tracking equipment, renters, and rentals. Data is
stored **in memory** (plain Python objects, no database) and is reset every
time the app restarts — this project is meant to run before you've covered
databases.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

The API runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Web UI

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in a browser for a basic HTML front end (plain
forms and tables, no JavaScript) to add/delete equipment and renters, and
check equipment in/out:

| Page | Path |
|---|---|
| Home | `/` |
| Equipment | `/ui/equipment` |
| Renters | `/ui/renters` |
| Rentals | `/ui/rentals` |

This UI is separate from the JSON API below — it's there so you can see the
app working without a REST client, and calls the same in-memory store.

## Entities

- **Equipment**: `id, name, category, total_units, available_units`
- **Renter**: `id, name, email, membership_date`
- **Rental**: `id, equipment_id, renter_id, rental_date, due_date, return_date`
