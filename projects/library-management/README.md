# Library Management System (LMS)

A small Flask REST API for tracking books, members, and loans. Data is stored
**in memory** (plain Python objects, no database) and is reset every time the
app restarts — this project is meant to run before you've covered databases.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

The API runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Web UI

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in a browser for a basic HTML front end (plain
forms and tables, no JavaScript) to add/delete books and members, and check
books in/out:

| Page | Path |
|---|---|
| Home | `/` |
| Books | `/ui/books` |
| Members | `/ui/members` |
| Loans | `/ui/loans` |

This UI is separate from the JSON API below — it's there so you can see the
app working without a REST client, and calls the same in-memory store.

## Entities

- **Book**: `id, title, author, isbn, total_copies, available_copies`
- **Member**: `id, name, email, membership_date`
- **Loan**: `id, book_id, member_id, loan_date, due_date, return_date`
